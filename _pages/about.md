Hi! I am a Carnegie Mellon University graduate in Master of Science of Mechanical Engineering - Research, with a concentration in **Robotics**. My interests lie in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and 3D vision for autonomous agents. During my time at the Robotics Institue, CMU I got the opportunity to work in the [The Airlab](https://theairlab.org/) and the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php). Here I worked on a multi-agent exploration project, called [MMPUG](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/project/mmpug-multi-model-perception-uber-good/), where I worked on extending [SuperOdometry](https://superodometry.com/), with [Shibo Zhao](https://shibowing.github.io/). Additionally, we also collaborated on collecting a Multi-modal multi-robot dataset, named [Subt-MRS](https://superodometry.com/datasets) which is currently under ICCV 2023 submission. This dataset will be used to host the [ICCV 2023 Workshop on Robot Learning and SLAM](https://superodometry.com/iccv23), for which I will be serving as a Organinzing Comittee Member.

I am actively looking for Software Engineering/Research Engineer roles in SLAM, Computer Vision, 3D Vision and perception. You can head to the [Projects Page](/projects) to have an overview of my work and can find my Resume [here](/cv). Feel free to contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dp-singh2899/) or [e-mail](mailto:damanprs@andrew.cmu.edu).
