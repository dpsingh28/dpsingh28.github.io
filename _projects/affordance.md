title: Open-Set Vocabulary Inter-Object (O2O) 3D Affordance Prediction in Point Clouds
description: <ul><li>Here, we enabled natural language query-driven affordance prediction in point clouds, reaching 90% performance relative to the SOTA of closed-set affordance prediction</li><li>I also performed ablation study for different point cloud architectures like PointNet, PointTransformer, and LLM architectures like CLIP, CG3D</li><li>Currently we are working on advancing this object-based affordance prediction to open-set vocabulary-based inter-object prediction, utilizing sim-in-the-loop training</li></ul>
