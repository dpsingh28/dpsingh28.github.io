title: Communications and Systems Engineering
description: <ul><li>I developed a C++ algorithm for generating a graph using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values from radios in a multi-robot setup, using Websockets and ROS-DDS</li><li>Using this graph, I innovated constraints for robot motion planning by utilizing spanning trees on this SNR graph, resulting in a communication network construction algorithm. This increased exploration distances by 90% against SOTA</li><li>I also devised 2 behavior trees for switching between 8 autonomy modes in the MMPUG multi-robot system with 3 UGVs and 2 Spots</li><li>Among other systems engineering tasks, I integrated and calibrated a FLIR-Boson thermal camera into the existing sensor stack of 6 RGB cameras, 1 IMU, and a LIDAR with <25 ms time sync delay and 60 Hz frequency</li></ul>
