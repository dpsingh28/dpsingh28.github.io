title: Multi-View Reconstruction
description: <ul><li>In this project, I built a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline from scratch, employing concepts such as perspective-n-point, 8-point algorithm, and traingulation</li><li>In addition to SfM, I also extended it to include Bundle adjustment, to improve camera extrinsics computation</li></ul>
