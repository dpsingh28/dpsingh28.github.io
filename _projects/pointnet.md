title: Point Cloud Classification and Segmentation
description: <ul><li>Here, I designed deep learning-based point cloud classification and segmentation models, including PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PointTransformer</li><li>Point Cloud classification was achieved with an average accuracy of ~95% whereas segmentation was achieved with an average accuracy of ~98%. Ablation studies with point cloud transformations were also performed</li></ul>
