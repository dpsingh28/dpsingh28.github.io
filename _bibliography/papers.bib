  title={High Speed Convoy in Unstructured Indoor Environments},

  abstract={Practical deployments of coordinated fleets of mobile robots in different environments
            have revealed the benefits of maintaining small distances between robots, especially as they
            move at higher speeds. However, this is counter-intuitive in that as speed increases, reducing
            the amount of space between robots also reduces the time available to the robots to respond to
            sudden motion variations in surrounding robots. However, in certain examples, the benefits in
            performance due to traveling at closer distances can outweigh the potential instability issues, for
            instance, autonomous trucks on highways that optimize energy by vehicle “drafting” or smaller
            robots in cluttered environments that need to maintain close, line of sight communication,
            etc. To achieve this kind of closely coordinated fleet behavior, this work introduces a model
            predictive optimal control framework that directly takes non-linear dynamics of the vehicles in
            the fleet into account while planning motions for each robot. The robots are able to follow
            each other closely at high speeds by proactively making predictions and reactively biasing
            their responses based on state information from the adjacent robots. This control framework is
            naturally decentralized and, as such, is able to apply to an arbitrary number of robots without
            any additional computational burden. We show that our approach is able to achieve lower interrobot distances at higher speeds compared to existing controllers. We demonstrate the success
            of our approach through simulated and hardware results on mobile ground robots},

  title={Subt-MRS: A Subterranean, Multi-Robot, Multi-Spectral and Multi-Degraded Dataset for Robust SLAM},
  author={Zhao, Shibo and Singh, Damanpreet and Scherer, Sebastian and others},
  abstract={In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) research. However, current state-of-the-art solutions still struggle with limited accuracy and robustness in real-world applications. 
            One major reason is the lack of datasets that fully capture the conditions faced by robots in the wild. To address this problem, we present SubT-MRS, an extremely challenging real-world dataset designed to push the limits of SLAM and perception algorithms. 

            SubT-MRS is a multi-modal, multi-robot dataset collected mainly from subterranean environments having multi-degraded conditions including structureless corridors, varying lighting conditions, and perceptual obscurants such as smoke and dust. Furthermore, the dataset packages information from a diverse range of time-synchronized sensors, including LiDAR, visual cameras, thermal cameras, and IMUs captured using varied vehicular motions like aerial, legged, and wheeled, to support research in sensor fusion, which is essential for achieving accurate and robust robotic perception in complex environments. To evaluate the accuracy of SLAM systems, we also provide a dense 3D model with sub-centimeter-level accuracy, as well as accurate 6DoF ground truth.  Our benchmarking approach includes several state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the challenges our datasets introduce, particularly in the case of multi-degraded environments.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
